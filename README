This software aims to provide an implementation of the famous Italian
card game "Scopa" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa). It is written
in Javascript and can work in any modern browser.
It provides 5 variations of the original game and 3 types of cards.

USAGE
=====
Open the file index.html with a web browser.

Alternatively you can use the Qt application, to be built as described in the
next section.

BUILDING (Qt application)
=========================

The Qt application is very simple. It is just a browser window, based on
Qt WebEngine, that opens the index.html file.

It requires at least Qt 5.7.0, since the Qt WebEngine shipped with this version
is based on Chromium 49.

To build the application run:

  qmake qt-application/scopa.pro
  make

You can use the following command to run the application:

  ./scopa
