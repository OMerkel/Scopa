GENERAL INFORMATIONS
====================

This software aims to provide an implementation of the famous Italian
card game "Scopa" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa). It is written
in Javascript and can work in any modern browser.
It provides 5 variations of the original game and 3 types of cards.

USAGE
=====

Open the file index.html with a web browser. Since this software uses some new
HTML features you must run it inside one of the following browsers:
 * Firefox 48 or any later version (Element.animate was introduced in version 48)
 * Chrome/Chromium 49 or any later version (css variables were introduced in version 49)

Alternatively you can use the Qt application, to be built as described in the
next section.

BUILDING (Qt application)
=========================

The Qt application is very simple. It is just a browser window, based on
Qt WebEngine, that opens the index.html file.

It requires at least Qt 5.7.0, since the Qt WebEngine shipped with this version
is based on Chromium 49.

The following instructions refer to a GNU/Linux system.

To build the application run:

  make

You can use the following command to run the application:

  ./build/bin/scopa

To install the application inside the DIR directory run:

  make DESTDIR=DIR install

Then you can run it with the following command:

  ./DIR/usr/bin/scopa

Or simply run "scopa" if DIR/usr/bin is in your PATH variable.

BUILDING AND RUNNING THE SERVER
===============================

The online server requires node.js and the ws module (https://github.com/websockets/ws).

To install the server inside the DIR directory run:

  make DESTDIR=DIR server

Then you can run it with the following command:

  node DIR/server.js
